puppet-vars2array
=================

This is a puppet module with a function that takes variables matching
a pattern and creates an array with their values. Parts of the var names
can also be extracted with regexp captures and added to the array as well.
This can be useful if you use the array2hash function from puppet-stdlib.

Docs and a proper module structure Coming Soon(tm)
